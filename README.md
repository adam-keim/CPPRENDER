# CPPRENDER
This is a rendering engine written in pure C++
##IDE
Please use the netbeans IDE, we have the nbproject files in our repo
###IMPORTANT###
Under the projects tab of netbeans, right click on the `Source Files` folder and click `add existing item`.  Then select `main.cc`.  This is normally stored in the `nbproject/private` directory which is system-specific so not relevant to this Repo.
###Command to build outside of netbeans
`./build.sh`
